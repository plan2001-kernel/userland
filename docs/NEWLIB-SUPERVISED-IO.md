# Newlib stdin/stdout/stderr over trusted Unix supervisor UXPIPE

The Plan2001 Unix supervisor retains the kernel's three **non-delegable**
console grants and creates three SPSC UXPIPE streams, each backed by two
independently mapped capability regions. A Newlib executable spawned with
the supervisor's `Oinheritv` grants receives an ordinary process-local
descriptor projection: `read(0)`, `write(1)`, `write(2)`, `close()`, and
`fstat()` dispatch through the shared UXPIPE implementation.

## Automatic startup binding

`ports/newlib/full/p9_newlib_start.c` runs
`p9_full_auto_bind_uxpipe()` before the application's `main()`. This uses
the kernel's own `SYSCTL(SysctlHandleList)` on the **calling process**, not
raw Handle guesses or a Unix kernel syscall. An inherited stream set is
accepted only if it contains exactly these six region grants in order,
plus one independent execute-only GE/O volume Handle:

| Region index | Stream | Child rights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | stdin data | `Vread` |
| 1 | stdin ACK | `Vwrite` |
| 2 | stdout data | `Vwrite` |
| 3 | stdout ACK | `Vread` |
| 4 | stderr data | `Vwrite` |
| 5 | stderr ACK | `Vread` |
| other | executable volume | `Vexecute` |

No inherited regions means *standalone* Newlib startup: its pre-existing
explicit stdin-ring API and authorized native console probes remain usable.
Any partial or excessive region-grant set fails closed before `main()`,
rather than selecting an arbitrary writable region or implicitly acquiring
the supervisor's console capabilities. `ObjOpenConsole` is never called
from Newlib's `_write` when supervisor UXPIPE is bound.

The public Newlib `read()` and `write()` forward through
`ports/newlib/full/posix_forward.c` into the native `_read` and `_write`
adapters in `plan2001_syscalls.c`. File descriptors 3+ independently use
the explicitly bound trusted `UxService` and `UxFdTable`. These are
userspace descriptors, **not** kernel Handle numbers.

The UXPIPE protocol uses bounded buffer cursors, acquire/release ordering,
peer-mapping startup rendezvous, backpressure, and explicit EOF. `close()`
publishes a stream close, and `_exit()` also publishes close on still-open
stream endpoints after Newlib's normal exit-time stdio flushing.
When Newlib links `uxpipe.c`, the native millisecond sleep stub is used,
not POSIX `sleep(seconds)`.

## Actual-kernel acceptance

`.github/workflows/newlib-libc.yml` builds pinned upstream Newlib 4.6.0,
a trusted native F5 supervisor, and a separate Newlib child ELF; **no**
legacy Plan2001 `libc-user.a` is linked into the Newlib child. The
disposable GE/O image contains these two ELFs. The real Plan2001 kernel
launches the child using attenuated `Oinheritv` capabilities.

`tools/ci/f5_console_accept.py` in `newlib-supervised` mode injects
physical QEMU PS/2 input and decodes F5 VGA output. It verifies independent
stdout/stderr markers, an input echo produced using Newlib's public
`read(0)`, F1/F5 console isolation, and eventual supervisor session
completion. The original full-Newlib stdio/heap/libm probe and
exit(0)/exit(7) Process Handle tests still run independently.

**Not claimed:** POSIX terminal/job control, full ash, general Unix
file-service RPC between processes, multi-threaded Newlib, or physical
hardware. The existing kernel ABI and capability model are unchanged.

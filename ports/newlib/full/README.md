# Native Newlib 4.6.0 libc for Plan 2001 AMD64

This is a **working upstream Newlib libc.a/libm.a port** for the
native Plan 2001 AMD64 OEXECUTE ABI. No Plan 2001 libc-user.a
is linked into the target Newlib applications.

Verified pipeline: [GitHub Actions #43586391276](https://github.com/plan2001-kernel/userland/actions/runs/43586391276).
The **newlib-full-libc-amd64** artifact contains full libraries,
native ELFs, symbol audits and real QEMU serial logs (14-day retention).

## Reproducible inputs

- Upstream Newlib 4.6.0 commit: 8ba4275b83ec27529f67e0d477611fa6d8d6e6bd.
- Pinned Plan 2001 kernel: 82814608dff31f2b33e34689821c468b69d7641e.
- GitHub Ubuntu 24.04, GCC 14, Clang/LLD, QEMU/OVMF.
- Newlib built for x86_64-unknown-elf as freestanding, single-threaded,
  with external native syscall adapters and no host Linux libc.
- Actual commands: .github/workflows/newlib-libc.yml.
  Use Actions workflow_dispatch on the experimental branch.

## Verified CI stages

1. Sparse-checkout Newlib tag and check its exact commit SHA.
2. Compile complete upstream libc.a, libm.a and public headers.
   Audit printf, snprintf, malloc, free and reentrancy symbols.
3. Compile the pinned native kernel, UEFI loader, MicroPython and ABI stubs.
4. Compile native startup and target syscall adapters against real
   Newlib headers, not Linux headers.
5. Link two AMD64 ET_EXEC images without Plan9 libc-user.a; audit exactly
   two PT_LOAD segments, no dynamic interpreter/dependencies, and all
   required symbols resolved.
6. Boot newlib-boot.elf in actual Plan 2001 QEMU; check Newlib
   printf/snprintf, malloc/free, strtol, errno, libm sin, stdin fgets
   from capability Region, stdout via ObjOpenConsole, gettimeofday
   from native _NSEC, and POSIX sleep(1) taking seconds, not milliseconds.
7. Boot MicroPython; spawn newlib-exit.elf as two independent ordinary
   processes, and observe Newlib exit(0)/exit(7) via Process Handles.

All images are newly created disposable regular-file GE/O volumes.
Never pass a real block device to the CI volume creation scripts.

## Architecture and native ABI

Plan 2001 starts the ELF at its existing AMD64 startup.S entry:
RAX initially holds Tos and RSP contains argc/argv.
p9_newlib_start.c calls main() and then **Newlib exit()**.

The native boundary is in plan2001_syscalls.c and posix_forward.c.
Only the generated syscall stubs from the kernel are linked.
The native sleep/alarm stub symbols are renamed before linking
because they take milliseconds, unlike POSIX sleep(seconds).

| API | Implemented behavior |
| --- | --- |
| read(0) | Authorized read-only capability Region ring + WAIT |
| write(1/2) | ObjOpenConsole and ObjOpWrite via OBJINVOKE |
| sbrk | Shared native BRK_ heap break, no second allocator |
| exit | Native EXITS: empty on success, nonempty on failure |
| gettimeofday | Native _NSEC nanosecond real-time clock |
| sleep | Seconds converted to bounded native milliseconds |
| fstat/isatty/close | Restricted console and Region semantics |
| lseek | ESPIPE for streams |
| getpid | Own-process SYSCTL process info |
| pathname/process/signal POSIX calls | Explicit errors, not fake success |

## Deliberate limitations

This is a **real full libc port**, not a claim of complete POSIX support.
The library is configured single-threaded; TLS, concurrency and all
optional APIs are not certified. stdin needs an explicit granted Region
and stdout/stderr native console authority; children do not inherit
rights automatically. No general pathname/FD table or Unix pipe/TTY
layer is present. Native EXITS preserves success versus failure but not
the exact numeric POSIX exit code. sbrk does not shrink. POSIX alarm,
fork/exec, signals and arbitrary files are not implemented.

No kernel ABI changes, physical hardware tests or full GNU/BusyBox
Newlib linking were made. The prior Newlib-subset/libgloss QEMU tests
remain independent regression coverage. Future Unix semantics belong
in Userland adapters, not new kernel syscalls.
